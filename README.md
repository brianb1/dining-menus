# dining-menus

Check the UCLA dining hall menus from the comfort of your terminal!

## About

I created this tool mainly as a fun way for me to start learining how to use Beautiful Soup, but it's turned out to be pretty handy for me, so I'm sharing it with anyone else who might find it useful. Feel free to download it, modify it, or use it as a starting point for any other UCLA dining hall tools. (If you do, please let me know!)

## Dependencies

This project depends on Python >= 3, Requests, and BeautifulSoup.

## Usage

To use, just run the script!
